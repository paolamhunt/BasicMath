I am so excited about this :D I was originally going to upload all of my school projects in their own repos BUT then I started fiddling around with BOOTSTRAP and HTML and figured out a way to keep everything in one single place.</br></br>
The only icon that has anything useful at this moment is the "Math" icon. I can't wait to upload the rest.</br></br>
Math Projects</br>
Bring on the nostalgia feelings! This is my first ever python code that I wrote for school. The "Homework" files consist of 8 Problems that I had to code based on that week's lecture. After I graduate I plan to add some more explanation behind the code, to include prompts and my own documentation, but for now this will do. </br></br>
I included the Python notebook file which was created on jupyter notebook. Additionally, I included the html file my professor had us download a copy in this format for reasons that currently escape me. EDIT: I used the .html file for my GIT Page </br></br> 
I added the python workflow. I'm still new at this but im hoping that this will help load the file. EDIT: this worked! I think I'm slowly getting the hang of GIT, maybe.
